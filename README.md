Game to learn C# : console application of random dungeon generator in with RPG elements.

This branch is for solving the problem i have with key-pressing : I just can't seem to make the menu work (on key press, do this method, etc.) in a cohrent fashion the way I want it to. I am even wondering if what I'm trying to do actually works in a console version.
